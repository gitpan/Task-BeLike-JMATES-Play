A distribution to install modules that I like to use for non-work
related purposes; see Makefile.PL for the list of these modules.

Install from CPAN:

  cpan Task::BeLike::JMATES::Play

Or the latest version:

  git clone http://github.com/thrig/Task-BeLike-JMATES-Play
  cd Task-BeLike-JMATES-Play
  cpanm .

Or the old fashioned way:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
